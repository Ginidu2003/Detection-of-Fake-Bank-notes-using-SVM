# Detection-of-Fake-Bank-notes-using-SVM
I conducted my own EDA and data preprocessing, implemented the SVM algorithm, tuned hyperparameters for optimal selection, evaluated performance, and compared my results with those in the research article "Machine Learning Based Approach for Detection of Fake Banknotes Using Support Vector Machine," which focuses on SVM classification of banknotes.
